# Module 20 Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge
## Summary

I am a member of the data science team of a medical research company thatâ€™s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. My supervisor has asked me to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning. I was provided with raw data, so I processed it to fit the machine learning models. I used several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups.

After analyzing the data I have determined the following:
- Using dimensionality reduction, I reduced the number of independent variable from 15 to 10  
- Addition TSNE reduction reduced the number of independent variable to 2 while accounting for .90 variability
- Plotting TSNE results at learning_rate=30, perplexity=30 revealed that patients may be able to be separated into 5 or 6 clusters
- Analyzing K means from 1 to 10 also revealed that k clusters may the the optimal number of groups for the data
