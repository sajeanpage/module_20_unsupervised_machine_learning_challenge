# Module 20 Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge
## Summary

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, you am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

After analyzing some of the data I have determined the following:
- Riders were mostly males and females between the ages of 22 and 40 during this time period.  
- With exceptions accounted for, the 28 year old males were the largest constituency.
- Most rides were started at stations near affluent zip codes near leasure locations like shopping districts or parks.
- The mean bike usage was about 550 trips during the observation period.
- There were some outliers that made over 1600 trips during this period.  Those bikes are good candidates for maintenance.
- Bikes that were the most used usually completed their rides near an interstate, bridge, or a major transportation connector
